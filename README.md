# Brogramming_1
Intro To Brogramming

This is the git repository for our first programming project!  Here are some things to get started with.

## Installing a Text Editor
Life is easier when using a text editor to write code.  There are many, but I'm suggesting Atom for what we're doing.  This is because:
- It's not too big of a program
- The interface is relatively uncluttered
- It's pretty
- I'm using it, so I can try to answer any questions you have

### Step 1: Install Atom
You can download it here:
https://atom.io/

### Step 2: Install Some Atom Packages
There's some extra stuff we can install into the text editor that makes it easier to both write and fix our code.
The welcome guide panel makes it pretty easy to find the package installer button.

Atom comes with a bunch of packages already installed, so some of the things in this list might already be installed.
